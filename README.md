# 🎮 Trigonometric Defence  

**Gamified Learning with Flutter** ✨  
A unique fusion of **mathematics** 📐 and **gameplay** 🎮 designed to make **trigonometric functions** engaging, fun, and unforgettable.  

---

## 🌌 Storyline
You are the **last line of defence** in a vast desert battlefield.  
- The defence system is placed at the **center of a circular field**.  
- Enemies spawn on the **circumference of the circle**.  
- To destroy them, you must use the **power of trigonometric functions** to calculate their positions and distances.  

Each type of enemy belongs to a **specific trigonometric function**:  
- **Sine Army (sin θ)** → swift and numerous.  
- **Cosine Raiders (cos θ)** → balanced and unpredictable.  
- **Tangent Beasts (tan θ)** → powerful but unstable.  

Your mission: **apply the right function at the right time** to protect humanity. 🌍
